We strive for a comprehensive registry of Earth Sciences IM software that is searchable by task (e.g. quality control) and common software attributes (e.g. language), as well as provide a community forum for discussing the development of new ideas. We emphasize free and open source software but do not exclude proprietary sources.

### Search

Software is tagged with terms from a [controlled vocabulary](http://vocab.lternet.edu/vocab/registry/index.php) organized around common IM tasks found in the research data life-cycle. Use this vocabulary when searching by keyword.

### Results

Results contain high-level information for you to quickly evaluate fitness for use, find additional details, and access the software. As of 2019-07-21, the registry contains 183 software items implemented primarily in R and Python and spanning a broad range of IM tasks.
