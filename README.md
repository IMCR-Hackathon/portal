We provide a comprehensive registry of Earth Sciences IM software that is searchable by task (e.g. quality control) and common software attributes (e.g. language), as well as provide an community forum for discussing new ideas to be developed. We emphasize free and open source software but do not exclude proprietary sources.

### Search

Software is tagged with terms from a controlled vocabulary organized around common IM tasks found in the research data life-cycle. Use this vocabulary when searching by keyword.

Search results contain high-level information for you to quickly assess fitness for use and links you to additional details and where the software can be accessed.
