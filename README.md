We strive for a comprehensive registry of IM software for the Environmental Sciences that is searchable by task (e.g. quality control) and software attribute (e.g. language), as well as provide a community forum to explore the development of new ideas. We emphasize free and open source software of all maturity levels and do not exclude proprietary sources.

### Search

Software is tagged with terms from a [controlled vocabulary](http://vocab.lternet.edu/vocab/registry/index.php) organized around IM tasks occuring throughout the research data life-cycle. Use this vocabulary when searching by keyword.

### Results

Metadata enables quick evaluation for fitness of use and access to the software. As of 2019-07-21, the registry contains 183 software items written in R and Python, spanning a broad range of IM tasks.

### Participate

Adding software to the registry is easy! [Sign up for an account](http://imcr.ontosoft.org/#users) and reference our [registration guidelines](http://wiki.esipfed.org/index.php/Best_practices#IMCR_2) to ensure the software is easily findable and understandable. Remember, the software doesn't need to be production grade to be a part of the registry.

Join our community discussions! We meet regularly [(first Wednesday of the month, 2 pm EDT)](https://global.gotomeeting.com/join/701843053) to explore new ideas, trends, challenges, and oportunities and have [an email list](https://lists.esipfed.org/mailman/listinfo/esip-imcoderegistry) for out of band communications. Everyone ("developers" and "non-developers") is welcome!
